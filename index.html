              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>Matt is a senior at the University of Cincinnati studying <a target="_blank" href="https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science/degrees-programs/computer-science-bachelor-of-science.html">computer science</a> and pursuing a <a target="_blank" href="https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/degrees-programs/cyber-operations-certificate.html">certificate</a> in cyber operations with a focus on cyber attacks and security.</p>
              <h3>Experience</h3>
              <p>Matt has completed multiple co-op rotations with two companies. He began at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexmark.com/en_us.html">Lexmark International</a> in May, 2022, and finished his second rotation there in April, 2023. He then joined <a target="_blank" href="https://shp.com/">SHP</a> in August, 2023, and completed his fourth co-op in August, 2024.</p>
              <p>Matt has taken several courses at the University of Cincinnati which have given him a greater understanding of computer science and cyber security in general. Some of the courses Matt has taken have given him opportunities such as writing his own malware, reverse engineering real-world malware samples, hacking his classmates, hacking his professors, and defending his own online services from attackers. As such, Matt has expertise not only in the broader domain of computer science, but also in cryptography, security, and networking.</p>
              <p>In his free time, Matt also manages a homelab. He has a dedicated machine running <a target="_blank" href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>, which allows him to deploy multiple distinct operating environments simultaneously. With this capability, Matt runs a Windows 10 machine for schoolwork, and an Ubuntu Server machine which hosts services such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, and more. Additionally, Matt hosts his own instance of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">Vaultwarden</a> password manager on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.</p>

              <h2>Course Information</h2>
              <h3>Labs</h3>
              <h4>Lab 0</h4>
              <p>In this lab we set up our development environments for the course. We created Ubuntu 22.04 VMs and installed a number of tools to help us during the course, including Apache, VS Code, Wireshark, and Google Chrome.</p>
              <h4>Lab 1</h4>
              <p>This lab explored the HTTP protocol for communicating with web servers. I made use of Wireshark to analyze packets created during HTTP GET request/HTTP OK response exchanges using a web browser. I analyzed packets created using telnet to send HTTP GET requests without a web browser. I wrote a Common Gateway Interface in C and deployed it using Apache Web Server. I deployed a simple PHP web application. I wrote a PHP web application to study sending data through HTTP GET requests. I used the *curl* tool to send HTTP POST requests.</p>
              <h4>Lab 2</h4>
              <p>This lab covered topics such as using HTML to display and arrange information on a webpage, including forms in a webpage, and using JavaScript to implement client-side logic. The lab also covered the use of Ajax, CSS (inline and linked), jQuery, and the use of web APIs to pull in functionality from the internet.</p>
              <h3>Hackathons</h3>
              <h4>Hackathon 1</h4>
              <p>This hackathon covered cross-site scripting attacks. We practiced executing attacks on a web application in which we had to force the page to send an alert with our name in it. In the second half of the hackathon, we applied defensive measures to our own web applications to counter the attacks we had used.</p>
              <h3>Projects</h3>
              <h4>Project 1</h4>
              <p>This project required us to create personal webpages with information about ourselves, the course, and the assignments we completed. We were required to use basic HTML elements to structure our content, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and web APIs to allow dynamic content, and to utilize technologies of our own choosing to style the page, include a tracker, use a graphic web API, and handle cookies.</p>

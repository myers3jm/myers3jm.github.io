          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Jared is a graduate from the University of Cincinnati with a BS in <a target="_blank" href="https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science/degrees-programs/computer-science-bachelor-of-science.html">computer science</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/degrees-programs/cyber-operations-certificate.html">certificate</a> in cyber operations with a focus on cyber attacks and security.</p>
          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <p>Jared has worked in a variety of IT roles for a total of 22 months of professional and volunteer experience. He began as a teacher's aid at Jonathan Alder High School, assisting in preparing students to take the CompTIA A+ certification exam. He also served as a teacher's aid in an introductory course to the Python programming language. He then volunteered at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.miamioh.edu">Miami University</a> in April, 2018, serving as a system administrator for the Redhawk Hunt scavenging event. He then joined <a target="_blank" href="https://atos.net/">Atos</a> in June, 2020 where he assisted Northrup Grumman employees with computer-related issues.</p>
          <p>Jared has taken several courses at the University of Cincinnati which have given him opportunities such as reverse engineering real-world malware samples, hacking his classmates, hacking his professors, and defending his own online services from attackers.</p>
          <p>In his free time, Jared also manages a homelab. He has a dedicated machine running <a target="_blank" href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>, which allows him to deploy multiple distinct operating environments simultaneously.</p>
